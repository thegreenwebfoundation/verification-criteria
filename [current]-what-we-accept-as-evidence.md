# What we accept as evidence of green power

This page is for data center operators and web hosting providers, who want to get verified as a verified green hosting provider. On this page you will find information about the kind of evidence required in order to get verified, as well as additional information about the context of that evidence and examples to use as a guide.

*Note: This is a living document. We review and update it periodically based on updates in the regulatory landscape, new scientific evidence, and changes to the way industry operates. This document was last modified on:*

When wanting to get verified as a green provider, we need to see evidence of the steps you are taking to **avoid**, **reduce**, or **offset** the greenhouse gas emissions caused by using electricity to provide your service/s. We will expand on these terms in more detail later in this document, but to set the scene here are brief definitions of each.

- **Avoid** - This means you're running on 100% renewable power, or are operating in regions where the grid is overwhelmingly powered by renewable energy.
- **Reduce** - This is when you still use fossil fuel electricity from your local grid, but account for the emissions of this energy by using vehicles like a green tariff or environment attribute certificates.
- **Offset** - This means you still use fossil fuel electricity from your local grid, but account for the emissions of this energy by purchasing quality carbon offsets from a reputable provider/marketplace.

In addition to the above, we also need to see that the evidence provided is **timely**, **makes a material difference**, and whenever possible **in the public domain**. To better understand what each of these means, you can expand and read the sections below.

   - **Yes!** [Find out what evidence is required](#avoid-scenario-1)
   - **No**. Go to question 2.

2. Do you operate in a region that has a grid intensity of less than 20g CO2e/kWh or uses over 99% renewable power?
   - **Yes!** [Find out what evidence is required](#avoid-scenario-2)
   - **No**. Go to question 3.

3. Do you directly pay for green energy to cover the non-green energy we use?

## Avoiding greenhouse gas emissions from your operations

Your organisation **avoids** greenhouse gas emissions caused by using electricity to provide your service/s. This can be either by using 100% renewable power, or by operating in regions where the grid is overwhelmingly powered by renewable energy.

#### Scenario 1: We use 100% green energy from our own infrastructure

In the last full calendar year, your organisation has drawn all its power from renewable sources all the time, and did not draw power from the grid.

##### Evidence required

- Evidence that you have facilities onsite to make this possible. This can include:
  - Power generation and usage data from renewable energy infrastructure.
  - A public, verified third-party audit showing that all power comes from the claimed renewable source.

Still got questions? See the FAQ.

#### Scenario 2: We operate in a region that has an annual average grid intensity of less than 20g CO2e/kWh or uses over 99% renewable power.

In the last full calendar year, your organisation operated in a region where the grid was on average as close to completely green as possible. For us, that means it had an annual average grid intensity of less than 20g CO2e/kWh or generating over 99% of its electricity from renewable sources.

These are currently rare, but as more countries transition their own grids to renewables we expect to see this scenario more often.

##### Evidence required

- A statement from the government, or regional energy provider, about the generation of renewable energy in that area.
- Pointing to annual average grid intensity figures from a reputable source like Ember Climate, or Electricity Maps.

Example

The Government of Canada publishes data about the electricity generation of each region, including figures for greenhouse gas emissions intensity  (g CO2e/kWh).

## Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from your operations

Your organisation **reduces** greenhouse gas emissions caused by using electricity to provide your service/s. This can be by purchasing green energy tariffs, or environment attribute certificates. Or, this could be through funding renewable energy projects.

#### Scenario 1: We directly pay for green energy to cover the non-green energy we use

In the last full calendar year, your organisation has drawn power from the energy grid in regions you operate, but you accounted for the amount of power coming from fossil fuels by directly purchasing that amount of renewable energy. This is usually called **a green tariff**.

##### Evidence required

- A document showing you are using a green tariff. We strongly recommend making this public.

##### Example

Hetzner uses green energy tariffs for their data centres in Germany and Finland.

Still got questions? See the FAQ.

#### Scenario 2: We purchase environmental attribute certificates or have guarantees of origin

In the last full calendar year, your organisation has drawn power from the energy grid in regions you operate, but you can prove that you are generating an equivalent amount of green energy to cover the power coming from fossil fuels in that grid. This can be through environment attribute certificates, or guarantees of origin.

You can show you are paying to put at least as much green power into the grid as you use.

##### Evidence required

- Evidence of how much fossil fuel energy your organisation has consumed.
- Evidence to show that you have accounted for this.
  - A purchased environment attribute certificate (EAC).
  - A document showing guarantee of origin for any green power purchased.

Example

Greengeeks uses renewable energy certificates to account for the fossil fuel energy used by their operations.

Still got questions? See the FAQ.

#### Scenario 3: We directly fund renewable energy projects

In the last full calendar year, your organisation has drawn power from the energy grid in regions you operate, but you can prove that you funded renewable energy projects that generated an equivalent amount of green energy to cover the power coming from fossil fuels in that grid.

##### Evidence required

- Evidence of how much fossil fuel energy your organisation has consumed.
- Evidence to show that you have accounted for this.
  - An official document, invoice, or other similar evidence from a renewable energy project you have funded. This should include the amount of renewable energy the project puts/will put onto the grid.

Example

Ripple Energy crowdfunded the construction of Craig Fatha, a consumer owned wind turbine, to account for the fossil fuel energy used by their operations.

### Offsetting greenhouse gas emissions from your operations

Your organisation **offsets** greenhouse gas emissions caused by using electricity to provide your service/s. This can be by purchasing quality carbon offsets from a reputable provider/marketplace.

We recommend using offsets only as a last resort. If you are not able to directly purchase renewable energy, a green tariff, or renewable energy credits then offsets can be used as evidence when seeking to be a verified provider.

In other instances, you don’t know exactly how much fossil fuel energy usage you need to account for. We often see this when upstream providers do not disclose where the power used to deliver your services comes from. In this case, you can purchase offsets to make up for this.

![Image](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Kf6iGWGm1uqwqIGzJlJlj-xdl04JRmat8MZCJFThTw0DX1Sjp7hculI7Ohk9Pv9oggAQloXdV_RDqESlu4Q6IvikRO3QuCVmutFDs9yOUn4Z_xNyt10Pgbdez0ziWCqUNc10D4NA)

#### Scenario 1: We purchase quality carbon offsets to cover the non-green energy we use.

In the last full calendar year, your organisation has drawn power from the energy grid in regions you operate, but purchased quality carbon offsets that reduce/remove/prevent a realistically equivalent amount of carbon dioxide to cover the power coming from fossil fuels you use.

##### Evidence required

- Emissions-related evidence for your operations. Upstream providers should be able to provide this, or you can use open source tools like Cloud Carbon Footprint to surface it.
- Evidence that the offsets you have purchased match the quantity of emissions.
- Evidence of the ‘vintage’ – what time period these offsets apply to. Offsets need to apply for the last full calendar years or newer. That means, in 2023 we would accept offsets for the year 2022 or 2023.
- A certificate from the provider of the offsets, which shows:
  - A serial number or identifier for the given scheme.
  - Public evidence of the offsets coming from a recognised scheme – VCS, Gold Standard, or another. You should provide a link to the scheme, which will be shown in our Directory.

Example

You are hosting with Amazon Web Services, and using services in regions where they do not make claims about accounting for the fossil energy they use.

You use the open source Cloud Carbon Footprint, to quantify the emissions caused, and you pay to account for the carbon emissions.

You can then purchase offsets matching or exceeding that amount of carbon emissions.

### Reselling or using an existing green provider

If you are a reseller for or are an active customer of a provider which is already listed in our Green Web Dataset, then we need you to provide the following evidence:

- Technical evidence that you use the upstream providers services, either via matching AS numbers or IP ranges. OR,
- An invoice from the provider to your organisation showing the infrastructure and services you are using (like hiring server racks, or virtual private servers).

Commercially sensitive information can be obfuscated, as long as we are still able to clearly see the relationship that exists and the services that are being utilised.

Still got questions? See the FAQ.

### Using a Provider that is not listed in our dataset

If you are using a provider which claims to be green, but which is not already listed in our Green Web Dataset, then we need you to provide the following evidence:

- An invoice from the provider to your organisation showing the infrastructure and services you are using (like hiring server racks, or virtual private servers).
- Evidence from the provider which supports their green claims. This can be in the form of green energy certificates, renewable energy credits, or any other the other evidence items documented in the sections above.

Commercially sensitive information can be obfuscated, as long as we are still able to clearly see the relationship that exists and the services that are being utilised.
