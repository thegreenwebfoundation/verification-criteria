# What we accept as evidence of green power

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This page is for data center operators and web hosting providers, who want to get verified as a verified green hosting provider. On this page you will find information about the kind of evidence required in order to get verified, as well as additional information about the context of that evidence and examples to use as a guide. </p>

<p><em><strong>Note: </strong>This is a living document. We review and update it periodically based on updates in the regulatory landscape, new scientific evidence, and changes to the way industry operates. This document was last modified on: </em></p>

<p>When wanting to get verified as a green provider, we need to see evidence of the steps you are taking to <strong><em>avoid</em></strong>, <strong><em>reduce</em></strong><em>,</em> or <strong><em>offset</em></strong> the greenhouse gas emissions caused by using electricity to provide your service/s. We will expand on these terms in more detail later in this document, but to set the scene here are brief definitions of each.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Avoid</strong> - This means you're running on 100% renewable power, or are operating in regions where the grid is overwhelmingly powered by renewable energy.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Reduce</strong> - This is when you still use fossil fuel electricity from your local grid, but account for the emissions of this energy by using vehicles like a green tariff or environment attribute certificates.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Offset</strong> - This means you still use fossil fuel electricity from your local grid, but account for the emissions of this energy by purchasing quality carbon offsets from a reputable provider/marketplace.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to the above, we also need to see that the evidence provided is <strong>timely</strong>, <strong>makes a material difference</strong>, and whenever possible <strong>in the public domain</strong>. To better understand what each of these means, you can expand and read the sections below.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We recommend using offsets only <em>as a last resort</em>. If you are not able to directly purchase renewable energy, a green tariff, or renewable energy credits then offsets can be used as evidence when seeking to be a verified provider.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In other instances, you don’t know <em>exactly how much</em> fossil fuel energy usage you need to account for. We often see this when upstream providers do not disclose where the power used to deliver your services comes from. In this case, you can purchase offsets to make up for this.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Scenario 1: We purchase quality carbon offsets to cover the non-green energy we use.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the <em>last full calendar year</em>, your organisation has drawn power from the energy grid in regions you operate, but purchased quality carbon offsets that reduce/remove/prevent a realistically equivalent amount of carbon dioxide to cover the power coming from fossil fuels you use.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Evidence required</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Evidence of the emissions associated with your operations. Your upstream provider should be able to provide you with this information. Alternatively, you can use open source tools like <a href="https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/">Cloud Carbon Footprint</a> to surface this information yourself.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Evidence that the offsets you have purchased match the quantity of emissions associated with your operations.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Evidence of the ‘vintage’ – what time period these offsets apply to. Offsets need to apply for the <em>last full calendar years or newer</em>. That means, in 2023 we would accept offsets for the year 2022 or 2023.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>A certificate from the provider of the offsets, which shows:<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>A serial number or identifier for the given scheme.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Public evidence of the offsets coming from a recognised scheme – VCS, Gold Standard, or another. You should provide a link to the scheme, which will be shown in our Directory.</li>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Example</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You are hosting with Amazon Web Services, and using services in regions where they do not make claims about accounting for the fossil energy they use.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You use the open source <a href="https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/">Cloud Carbon Footprint</a>, to quantify the emissions caused, and you pay to account for the carbon emissions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can then purchase offsets matching or exceeding that amount of carbon emissions.</p>
